# MAT5960 â€” Master Project

## Author

## Project Summary
This ongoing project simulates traffic flow using numerical methods inspired by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The programing languge is Python and the implementation is object-oriented and uses vectorized code to ensure efficiency and scalability. The code can be found under the folder src.

## Upcoming works
The scheme I use here is a Lax-Friedrics-type scheme. Currently, I am focusing on implementation of the convergence of the scheme to the entropy solution. 

This project is being conducted under the supervision of Professor Ulrik Skre Fjordholm at the University for Oslo (UiO).
