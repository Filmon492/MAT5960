\section{Introduction}
Since many interesting conservation laws that arise in applications (e.g. traffic simulation) are nonlinear, it is impossible to obtain explicit solution formulas.
Hence, we rely on designing numerical methods to approximate the solutions in the best possible way.
When designing such methods it is natural to ask ourselves how reliable those methods could be.
That is significant to study the stability and convergence of the numerical methods.

For the purpose of numerical experimentation we focus on the specific one dimensional traffic flow model which is
modeled by a nonlocal conservation law. In other words the goal is to design an efficient numerical method and ultimately to prove that the method convergences to the correct solution.
