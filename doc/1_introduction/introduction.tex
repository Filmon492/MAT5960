\section{Introduction}
Since many interesting conservation laws that arise in applications are nonlinear, it is impossible to obtain explicit solution formula.
Hence, we relay on designing numerical methods to approximate the solution in the best possible way.
When designing numerical methods it is natural to ask ourselves how reliable a method could be.
Therefore, we must study the stability and convergence of the numerical method.

For numerical experiment purpose we focus on the specific one dimensional traffic flow model which is
modeled by a nonlocal conservation law. So, the goal is to design an efficient numerical method and ultimately
to prove that the method convergence to the correct solution.
