When designing the Finite difference method, it consists of four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discretizing the domain,
    \item Fulfilling the equation at discrete points,
    \item Replacing derivatives by finite differences,
    \item Solve the discretized problem.
\end{enumerate}

If we take a look on step 3, it requires that solutions should be smooth. However, solutions of conservations laws
may not be differentiable or even not continuous. For this and other reasons, we must adapt the steps above to design
a reasonable numerical method.
